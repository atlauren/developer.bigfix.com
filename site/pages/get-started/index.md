title: Getting started

BigFix is a system-management suite of products that allows you to manage
heterogeneous environments.

Such environments might already be personalized and can include proprietary data
that is unknown to the default BigFix solution or to external applications that
BigFix interacts with. In this case you must let BigFix know that these
custom resources exist and instruct BigFix how to interact with them.

To help you implement these customizations, BigFix provides you with querying
and scripting proprietary languages that are platform-independent, to a certain
extent, and with APIs.

Using these languages and APIs you can:

<dl>
  <dt>[Manage custom content defined on clients](/get-started/custom-content/)</dt>
  <dd>To enforce custom policies, run commands to manage personalized content, and collect custom data and display it on the console.</dd>

  <dt>[Customize user interfaces](/get-started/customize-user-interfaces.html)</dt>
  <dd>To create your personalized interface to implement, for example, your custom dashboards and reports.</dd>

  <dt>[Integrate with external applications](/get-started/integrate-external-applications.html)</dt>
  <dd>To interact with proprietary or third party applications located on the server or clients.</dd>
  <!--  <dd>To interact with proprietary or third party applications located on the server or clients and aggregate data sources to run reports.</dd> -->
</dl>
