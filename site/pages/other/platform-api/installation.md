title: Installing the Server API
---

After you successfully install BigFix, follow these steps to install the Server API on a Windows system:
1. Download the BigFix Server API setup from the same place as the other BigFix installers.
It has a name of the form: BigFix-BES-ServerAPI-9.5.xxx.0.exe.
The numbers in the name correspond to the version.
This version must match the version of the BigFix Server that you want to access with the API.
2. After you download it, run the program. The installer window opens.
3. Click **Next**. In the destination folder dialog you can select in which path 
you want to install the Server API.
4. Click **Next** and then **Install** to start the installation. The installer creates 
a folder named BES Server API, typically in the BigFix Enterprise folder. 
In this folder are the API DLLs you need to access the platform.
5. When the installation completes, click **Finish** to exit the installation wizard. 
6. Reboot the server.
