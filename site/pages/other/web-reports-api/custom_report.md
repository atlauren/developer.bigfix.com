title: Custom report
---

A custom report is constructed from HTML, relevance expressions, and JavaScript.
The ```<Data>``` tag contains a definition of the report in a ```CDATA``` block to
allow the HTML and JavaScript portions to be presented normally, without the need
for escape characters.

This is a custom web report that retrieves and prints the names of your networked
computers:

```xml
<BESWebReport>
  <Name>Example Custom Report</Name>
  <Description>A customized report, prints all computer names.</Description>
  <Type>CustomReport</Type>
  <Category>Custom Report</Category>
  <Source>HCL</Source>
  <Data>
    <![CDATA[
      <div>Computer Names</div>
      <?Relevance names of bes computers?>
    ]]>
  </Data>
</BESWebReport>
```
