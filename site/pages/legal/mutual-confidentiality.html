<p><strong>By using developer.bigfix.com, you may be subject to and, if so,
will comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement relating to HCL
disclosures set forth below.</strong></p>

<p>This Confidentiality Agreement ("Agreement") provides protection
for confidential information ("Confidential Information") exchanged
among the participants of a community or other component
on developer.bigfix.com ("Site"). By accessing and using the Site, each of us
agree that following terms apply when one of us discloses Information
("Discloser") to the other ("Recipient") in a community or other component
on the Site.</p>

<p>This Agreement pertains solely to disclosures by Discloser of Confidential
Information in a community, or other component on the Site.
Disclosures outside of the Site may be subject to additional
or other confidentiality agreements, and this Agreement does not supersede
or otherwise affect any such other confidentiality agreements.</p>

<p>For five (5) years after the date of disclosure, the Recipient will:
i) use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure of the Discloser's
Confidential Information as the Recipient uses
with its own similar information which it does not wish to disclose;
and ii) use Discloser’s Confidential Information only in connection
with the activities contemplated on the Site.</p>

<p>The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to:
i) its employees and employees of its parent and majority owned affiliates
who have a need to know; and ii) any other party with the Discloser's prior
written consent. Before disclosure to any of the above parties,
the Recipient must have an appropriate agreement with such party sufficient
to require that party to treat Confidential Information in accordance
with this Agreement. The Recipient may disclose and use the ideas, concepts,
know-how and techniques related to Recipient’s business activities
which are contained in the Discloser’s Confidential Information and retained
in the memories of Recipient’s employees who have had access
to the Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement. The Recipient
may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law,
but must give the Discloser reasonable prior notice to allow the Discloser
a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order. No obligation
under this Agreement will apply to Confidential Information that is:
i) already in Recipient’s possession or received by Recipient
without a non-disclosure obligation; ii) developed independently by Recipient;
or iii) publicly available when received, or thereafter
becomes publicly available through no fault of the Recipient.</p>

<p>This Agreement does not require any participant to disclose Confidential
Information. Recipient may not assign or otherwise transfer its rights
or delegate its duties or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Discloser. Only a written agreement
signed by the participants of the associated community or component
on the Site can modify this Agreement. Any participant may terminate
this Agreement by providing one month’s written notice
to the other participants. Any provisions of this Agreement
which by their nature extend beyond its termination remain in effect
until fulfilled and apply to our respective successors
and authorized assigns.</p>

and exclusive agreement regarding our disclosures of Confidential Information
on the Site. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York.
All participants in a community or component on the Site hereby waive
its rights to a jury trial. This Agreement and the Terms of Use for the Site
are the complete and exclusive agreement regarding our disclosures
of Confidential Information on the Site. Neither this Agreement
nor any disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder grants the Recipient
any right or license under any trademark, copyright or patent now or hereafter
owned or controlled by the other participants. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
PROVIDED BY A DISCLOSER IS PROVIDED SOLELY ON AN “AS IS” BASIS.</p>
