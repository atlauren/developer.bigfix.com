title: HCL Confidential Disclosure Agreement
---

<p><strong>By using developer.bigfix.com, you may be subject to and, if so,
will comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement relating to HCL
disclosures set forth below.</strong></p>

<p>This Confidentiality Agreement ("Agreement") provides protection
for confidential information ("Confidential Information") provided
by International Business Machines Corporation or its affiliates
(together, "HCL") in a community or other component on developer.bigfix.com
("Site"). By accessing and using the Site, you agree the following terms
will apply when HCL discloses Confidential Information to you ("Recipient")
in a community or other component.</p>

<p>This Agreement pertains solely to disclosures by HCL of Confidential
Information in a community or other component on the Site.
Disclosures outside of the Site may be subject to additional
or other confidentiality agreements, and this Agreement does not supersede
or otherwise affect any such other confidentiality agreements.</p>

<p>For five(5) years after the date of disclosure, the Recipient will:
i) use the same care and discretion to avoid disclosure of HCL's Confidential
Information as the Recipient uses with its own similar information
which it does not wish to disclose; and ii) use HCL's Confidential Information
only for the benefit of HCL.</p>

<p>The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to: i) its employees
and employees of its parent and majority owned affiliates who have
a need to know; and ii) any other party with HCL's prior written consent.
Before disclosure to any of the above parties, the Recipient must have
an appropriate agreement with such party sufficient to require that party
to treat Confidential Information in accordance with this Agreement.
The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to the extent
required by law, but must give HCL reasonable prior notice to allow HCL
a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order. No obligation
under this Agreement will apply to Confidential Information that is:
i) already in Recipient's possession or received by Recipient
without a non-disclosure obligation; ii) developed independently by Recipient;
or iii) publicly available when received, or thereafter becomes
publicly available through no fault of the Recipient.</p>

<p>This Agreement does not require HCL to disclose Confidential Information.
Recipient may not assign or otherwise transfer its rights or delegate
its duties or obligations under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of HCL. Only a written agreement signed by both of us
can modify this Agreement. Either of us may terminate this Agreement
by providing one month's written notice to the other. Any provisions
of this Agreement which by their nature extend beyond its termination
remain in effect until fulfilled and apply to our respective successors
and authorized assigns. This Agreement is governed by the laws
of the State of New York. Each party hereby agrees to waive its rights
to a jury trial. This Agreement and the Terms of Use for the Site
are the complete and exclusive agreement regarding our disclosures
of Confidential Information on the Site. Neither this Agreement
nor any disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder grants the Recipient
any right or license under any trademark, copyright or patent now
or hereafter owned or controlled by HCL. HCL PROVIDES CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
SOLELY ON AN "AS IS" BASIS.</p>

<p>Any information or materials disclosed by Recipient to HCL will be deemed
non-confidential and HCL may use and disclose such information and materials
on an unrestricted basis without notice or compensation to you.</p>
